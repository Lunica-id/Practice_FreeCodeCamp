            <p>Dear Agent <span class="blurred">A.name,</span></p>
            <p>We have an emergency. The secret recipe for our <span class="blurred">Fuwa marshmallows</span> has been compromised. This recipe is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
            <p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Blablabla Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the recipe to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and recover the recipe before it's too late.</p>
            <p>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardise the entire operation.</p>
